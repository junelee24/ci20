<h1><span id="heading">"BUILT BY PROFESSIONALS, <br> FOR PROFESSIONALS"</span></h1>

<p><span id="intro">The first hair straightener was not considered an "interactive" system. In 1909,
    Isaac K. Shero patented the first hair straightener. It composed of two flat irons that had to be manually
    heated, then pressed together. The modern hair straightener is digital, making it a lot more interactive
    than it once was.</span></p>
<p><span id="target">	This product is marketed towards anyone who desires professional grade hair straightening
                        results in the comfort of their homes.</span></p>
<p><span id="achieve">	The functions of this hair straightener offer a bit more than the older versions of the product.
    While some straighteners provide about three preset temperature options, this particular product has a wider range of
    temperatures. This achieves diverse usage because the user can alter the product to different types of hair, different needs,
    and different outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span id="steps">
1. Plug into an electric outlet
<br>2. Power on
<br>3. Set the preferred temperature by pressing the <br>  increase or decrease button
<br>4. Wait until the number on the screen stops at <br>  desired temperature. </span></p>
